Messy configuration files of an unemployed Linux lover

# Dependencies:

* [MPD](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD) & [mpc](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpc) for the tmux tmux-mpd script (But if you have ncmpcpp you'll obviously have them)

* The scripts needed are in "./scripts"

# Installation:
Idk, install them yourself, I'm to lazy for that ‚ù§
